3rd hour 1.4.7 project repo
The 🕺🏻default dance🕺🏻 is truly a 🖊masterpiece. Never❌in all of history🕖🕗🕘🕙🕚has such an artistic masterpiece🖊 ever been created. The choreography💃🏻 is possibly the most beautiful😍 sight👀 ever beheld by the human💁🏻‍♂️ eye👁. The sharp 🔪sound of the SLAP👏 when the player’s hands👐 collide perfectly 💯 with the beat of the song 🎵 sends a bone chilling☠️ shiver down my spine, every single time 🕘I hear it👂🏻. I find my self watching 👀my in-game 🎮avatar performing this phenomenal dance ritual 💃🏻for hours🕧 on end.
